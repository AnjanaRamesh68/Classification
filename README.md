Churn Prediction

This project is dedicated to predicting customer churn in a banking environment. It encompasses a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, which includes various statistical tests to unveil the key factors contributing to churn within the customer base. The analysis provides valuable insights into the dynamics of customer behavior and churn patterns. Moreover, the project implements three distinct machine learning algorithms: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). By utilizing these algorithms, we aim to create predictive models that can effectively forecast customer churn.
